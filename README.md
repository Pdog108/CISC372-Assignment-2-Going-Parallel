# CISC372-Assignment-2-Going-Parallel
CISC372 Programming Assingment #2
In this project, we will parallelize an algorithm to estimate the likelihood of getting a straight flush in a five card hand of poker.  We will start with an existing program which uses monte carlo methods and modify it to take advantage of parallelism
